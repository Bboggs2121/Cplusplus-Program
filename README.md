# Cplusplus-Program
The program created in C++ included in this repository was made to read an input file that contains one string on each line, and return a count for the product entered in those lines. I utilized a map to add the items into to keep each pair with its product name, and an integer (count). Once the product key is called, the count is returned. The menu choices provide options for the user to perform a specific task based on the integer they input into the program. For option 1, a product is searched for that is provided by the user in a prompt. After the user inputs a valid item in the list, the count is returned for the occurence of that item based on the input.txt file that was read. Option 2 provides a full list of all the items and their counts for the user to view. Option 3 provides a full list of all of the products and the count is printed with asterisks versus a number to display a histrogram type format. Option 4 allows the user to exit the program. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I provided the program with good code to protect the program from invalid inputs that may be entered by the user with the use of try and catch statements.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
